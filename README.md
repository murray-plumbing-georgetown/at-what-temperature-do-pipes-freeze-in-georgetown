# At What Temperature Do Pipes Freeze in Georgetown?

Water pipes in **Georgetown, California** can begin to freeze when temperatures drop to **32°F (0°C)** or lower. However, real-world pipe freezing often happens **before** that exact temperature due to wind chill, pipe location, insulation quality, and exposure.

This repository explains **when and why pipes freeze in Georgetown**, what conditions increase the risk, and how homeowners can prevent costly pipe damage during cold weather.

## When Do Pipes Typically Freeze?

While water freezes at 32°F, pipes often freeze when **air temperatures fall below 20°F for several consecutive hours**. In Georgetown, this risk increases during:

* Overnight cold snaps in winter
* Clear nights with no cloud cover
* Periods of sustained low temperatures
* Windy conditions that accelerate heat loss

Pipes located in unheated or exposed areas are the most vulnerable.
