        <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Pipe freezing is an infrastructure condition where heat loss causes water inside a distribution line to form ice, restricting flow and raising internal stress. In residential systems, this most often affects supply lines routed near exterior air or through unconditioned cavities, where drafts and insulation gaps create localized cold zones that cool pipe surfaces faster than occupied spaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Georgetown, freeze exposure can be shaped by foothill weather patterns, property layouts with longer service runs, and mixed-era construction where pipe routing and insulation practices vary. Detached garages, crawl spaces, and additions with limited thermal separation are commonly evaluated because they can behave differently than the main conditioned envelope during overnight temperature drops.

        <h2 id="process">Process &amp; Diagnostics</h2>
        <p>
          Evaluating when pipes may freeze in a specific structure involves identifying where heat loss outpaces the system’s ability to retain warmth. Diagnostic work typically focuses on routing (where pipes travel), exposure (how much cold air reaches them), and symptoms (restricted flow, intermittent pressure, or localized temperature differences along a run). The goal is to locate vulnerable segments and determine whether protective measures, repairs, or rerouting is appropriate for the building configuration.

        <h2 id="standards">Technical Standards &amp; Local Context</h2>
        <p>
          Plumbing work associated with freeze protection, repairs after freezing, and alterations to service routing may intersect with local inspection and permitting expectations depending on scope. Formal regional reference material for permitting and inspection context is maintained through the Sacramento County Building Permits and Inspection resource:
          <a href="https://www.saccounty.gov/Government/Pages/BuildingPermitsandInspection.aspx">Sacramento County building permits and inspection guidance</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practical terms, local context in Georgetown includes evaluating pipe placement in relation to exterior wall cavities, crawl space ventilation patterns, and retrofits performed over multiple construction eras. Documentation of materials, accessible shutoffs, and any structural changes affecting routing typically supports clearer review when inspection requirements apply.

          <h3>At what temperature do pipes freeze in Georgetown?</h3>
          <p>
            Freezing begins when pipe surfaces and the water inside lose enough heat for ice to form; in practice, exposure duration, wind, and unheated routing often matter as much as the air temperature.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Which pipes tend to freeze first in Georgetown homes?</h3>
          <p>
            Pipes in exterior walls, crawl spaces, garages, and other unconditioned areas typically freeze first because they are closer to outdoor air and have less retained heat.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>What is the typical professional approach to evaluating freeze risk?</h3>
          <p>
            A standard evaluation maps exposed runs, checks insulation and air leakage points, reviews shutoff access, and identifies segments where restricted flow suggests partial freezing or prior freeze-thaw stress.
